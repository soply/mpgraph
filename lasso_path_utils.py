        The sensing matrix A in 1/2 || Ax - y ||_2^2 + alpha ||x||_1
        restricted to the indices to which we want to calculate the hit value.

    y : array, shape (n_measurements)

        Contains the signs of the coefficients that are currently active, e.g.
        signum = np.array([1., -1., 1.]).
